# ETH_AVAX_MOD4PROJECT

    This project contains the program for my submission for the Module 4 project

## Description

    This program is written in solidity and my goal for this project is to create a ERC20 token and deploy it on the Avalanche network for Degen Gaming. The smart contract should have the following functionality:

    1. Minting new tokens: The platform should be able to create new tokens and distribute them to players as rewards. Only the owner can mint tokens.
    2. Transferring tokens: Players should be able to transfer their tokens to others.
    3. Redeeming tokens: Players should be able to redeem their tokens for items in the in-game store.
    4. Checking token balance: Players should be able to check their token balance at any time.
    5. Burning tokens: Anyone should be able to burn tokens, that they own, that are no longer needed.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., My_token.sol). Copy and paste the code stored in the DegenToken.sol file.

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.4" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile filename.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "MYTOKEN" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is now deployed, you can now interact with the mint and burn function. You can also interact with the declared variables to display their values.
